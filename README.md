# muzic for Claude Code

🇪🇸 **¿Hablás español?** Leé la [guía para productores](GUIA.md).

A plugin that lets Claude listen to a track: tempo, key, the chord
progression bar by bar, the energy arc, mood, genre, melody range and
loudness, then proposes the Ableton project setup and, if your Live set is
connected to Claude Code, applies it on your say-so.

No GitHub account needed. In a terminal (works for the terminal and the
desktop app alike):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/JinKazamaMishima/muzic-plugin.git
claude plugin install muzic@muzic
```

Restart Claude, then in the chat:

```
/muzic:setup
```

`/muzic:setup` asks for the password once and checks the connection. Then:

```
/muzic:listen ~/Music/bounces/my-track.wav
/muzic:replicate ~/Music/refs/that-track.wav
```

`listen` describes a track. `replicate` rebuilds its skeleton: drums as MIDI
with the swing, a one-bar drum loop, bass and melody MIDI, chords and sections,
ready for SMYLZ Producer to drop into Live.

Details, tools and troubleshooting: [`plugin/README.md`](plugin/README.md).
The analysis itself runs on a hosted service; the plugin is a thin client
that needs Node 18+ and nothing else.
